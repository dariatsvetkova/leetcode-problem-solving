We can store the values in a hash table or a list, which will enable us to search for the desired values in O(1). Node values correspond to their indices, so, for simplicity, we can use a list of numbers where each index also corresponds to the value of each node (with the 0th index being empty).\n",

We can see the length of the graph by looking at the adjacency list in each test case, but our algorithm won't have access to that list and won't know the size of the graph in advance. Hence, we will have to use a list with the maximum length of 100. \n",
