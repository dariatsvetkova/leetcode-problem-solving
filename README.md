# Leetcode Problem Solving

### :warning::construction: This repo is a work in progress

In this project, I am documenting my thought process when solving Leetcode problems. This includes code and reasoning at *all* stages of the process: algorithms that don't pass test cases, brute-force solutions, poorly performing solutions and the final, optimized algorithms.

The problems I am solving are taken from this list of the 75 most common problems for tech interviews: [link](https://www.teamblind.com/post/New-Year-Gift---Curated-List-of-Top-75-LeetCode-Questions-to-Save-Your-Time-OaM1orEU)
